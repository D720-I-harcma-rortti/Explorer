# Explorer
A bot designed to make pathing through oceans so much easier

Version 0.5 is now (somewhat) released!
The current version has several known issues, as well as a few unknown. We are working on all of them (trust us, we know)


# Planned features:

Complex routes via "waypoints" set by the user. This allows the bot to travel more complex routes by traveling through known good paths.

Land-mode. Traveling through cities and whatnot.

Dynamically switch from boating to walking.

Logging any issues it encounters.

And more (coming soon)
