# Explorer
A bot designed to make pathing through oceans so much easier

This bot is inspired by [SleepingFox's Travel Bot](https://github.com/SleepingFox8/AM-TravelBot) and updated for 1.18.2, designed for CivMC.
We are likely not going to backport, as the above bot works on older versions.

This bot is exclusively for JSMacros. Any other macro mod will likely not work.

Version 0.5 is now (somewhat) released!
The current version has several known issues, as well as a few unknown. We are working on all of them (trust us, we know)


# Planned features:

Complex routes via "waypoints" set by the user. This allows the bot to travel more complex routes by traveling through known good paths.

Land-mode. Traveling through cities and whatnot.

Dynamically switch from boating to walking.

Logging any issues it encounters.

Actual tutorial on how to use

And more (coming soon)
